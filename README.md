ADDRESS BOOK: 
This project is an Address Book Management System designed to help users efficiently manage their contact details. It allows users to add, search, print, edit, and delete contact information such as names, mobile numbers, 
email addresses, and physical addresses.

Key functionalities include:
Adding Contacts: Users can input new contact details, with validation checks for valid mobile numbers and email IDs to avoid duplicates. If the contact already exists, they are prompted to enter a different mobile number
or email.

Searching Contacts: Users can search for contacts by name, and if there are multiple matches, the system allows refining the search by mobile number or email address.

Displaying Contacts: Users can view all the contact details stored in the system.

Editing Contacts: Users can modify any details of an existing contact, such as the name, mobile number, email ID, or physical address.

Deleting Contacts: Users can delete contact records from the system by specifying the contact's name. If multiple records exist for the same name, the system allows the user to further refine the search by mobile number or
email ID before deletion.

The system ensures data integrity by performing validation checks during input, and it uses a temporary file to manage updates to the contact data. The user interface is designed for ease of use, allowing interaction through
a simple text-based menu.
